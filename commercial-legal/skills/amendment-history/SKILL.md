description: >
  Trace how a contract has changed across its base agreement and all amendments —
  either a summary of all changes over time, or a provision trace for a specific
  clause. Use when the user says "what changed in this contract over time", "show
  me the amendment history", "where's the latest [clause]", "how has [provision]
  evolved", or uploads multiple versions of an agreement.

# /amendment-history

Loads a base agreement and all amendments, then either summarizes what
changed over time or traces a specific provision to its current
controlling language.

## Instructions

### Step 0: Resolve the applicable jurisdiction

1. **Read the practice profile's `## Jurisdiction` section.** It gives the primary jurisdiction code, the footprint list (other codes the practice operates in), the output-language preference, and whether local counsel is available for escalation. Codes are ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 lowercase (`ksa`, `gbr`, `fra`, `che`, `usa`). If the section is missing or still a placeholder, stop: "The practice profile has no jurisdiction. Run the cold-start interview; nothing in this skill can run against the wrong jurisdiction."
2. **Determine the matter's jurisdiction(s).** Start from the primary code. Then read the matter facts: governing-law clause, seat of arbitration, place of employment, jurisdiction of incorporation, place of performance. If the facts point to a code not in the profile, add it for this matter and say so in the reviewer note. A matter may have more than one code (a contract governed by English law with a Saudi counterparty and Saudi performance is `gbr` + `ksa`). A foreign court forum or arbitral seat under a populated governing law is analysed from the populated code's enforcement rows (whether that forum's judgment or award would be enforced there); it does not add the foreign code unless the user asks for that law's view, and the reviewer note says the forum-side question was not analysed.
3. **Load the jurisdiction folder for each code.** The folder is `references/jurisdictions/<code>/` in this plugin (the same tree ships at the repo root and in every runtime adapter). Read `MANIFEST.md` first.
   - If `populated` is not `yes`: **stop for that code.** Say: "Jurisdiction `<code>` (<name>) is registered but not populated: no reference files exist for it. I will not apply another jurisdiction's rules or model knowledge in its place. Options: (1) populate `references/jurisdictions/<code>/` (see README, 'How to add a jurisdiction'), (2) route this matter to local counsel, (3) tell me to proceed with the analysis limited to the populated jurisdictions in this matter, with every finding for `<code>` marked `[not populated — no rule applied]`." Wait for the answer. Never fall back silently.
   - If the code is `usa`: there is no folder. Follow this skill's US path (the upstream doctrine and the upstream research connectors, CourtListener or Westlaw, with the upstream "no silent supplement" rule). Label findings `[usa]`.
   - If `populated` is `yes`: read `INDEX.md`, then the instrument files this skill names in its "Jurisdiction files" list. A row tagged `[settled — last confirmed YYYY-MM-DD]` may be applied and cited by article. A row tagged `[model knowledge — verify]` may be applied only with that tag carried onto the finding. If a rule this skill needs is not in the files at all, do not supply it from memory: say what is missing, tag the gap `[no rule in <code> files — verify]`, and continue only with the rules that exist.
4. **Multi-jurisdiction matters.** Run the relevant files side by side. Label every finding with its code in square brackets, `[ksa]`, `[gbr]`, `[usa]`, and never merge two jurisdictions' rules into one sentence. Where the codes conflict (a clause valid under one law and reducible under another), state both and flag `[review]` for the lawyer to decide which governs.
5. **Research step (when a rule must be quoted or its currency checked).** Use the portal named in `MANIFEST.md` → `research_tool`. For `ksa`: `python3 scripts/fetch-law.py --portal boe --id <guid> --lang ar` (GUIDs in `SOURCES.md`), or `curl -sS https://laws.boe.gov.sa/BoeLaws/Laws/LawDetails/<guid>/1`; the built-in web-fetch tool rejects the portal's TLS chain. Quote the article, tag `[BOE — Arabic]` (or `[BOE — official English]` when quoting the translation), and check the status line and the "تعديلات المادة" block for amendments. If the fetch fails or the article is not found, apply the "no silent supplement" rule: report the failure and stop. A stopped run still emits: the reviewer note (item 8) with `portal fetched: no` and a Sources line recording which fetch failed; every finding or number that depends on the unfetched article, listed as PENDING; and the options: (1) cite the jurisdiction file's row under its own `[settled — last confirmed YYYY-MM-DD]` tag, stating that the portal was not re-checked this session, (2) retry the fetch by another route (`curl`, the script) or hand the check to local counsel, (3) continue with the rule tagged `[model knowledge — verify]`. Take none of them until the user chooses. Nothing in a stopped run is tagged `[BOE — Arabic]` or `[BOE — official English]`.
6. **Calendar and language.** Take the weekend, public-holiday, calendar (Hijri or Gregorian) and currency rules from `MANIFEST.md`. Compute every date and roll-back against that calendar, never against a Saturday/Sunday weekend or US federal holidays. Produce the deliverable in English; when the profile's output-language preference is bilingual, or the manifest's authoritative language is not English and counterparty-facing text is produced, add the authoritative-language rendering of the bottom line, the findings table, and any counterparty-facing text, using the spellings in the manifest's `output_language_rule`.
7. **Header and disclaimer.** Prepend the manifest's `disclaimer` line under the work-product header for every deliverable that applies a non-`usa` jurisdiction. For `ksa`: "Arabic text is authoritative; English translations are for convenience; a licensed Saudi lawyer must review before reliance." with its Arabic rendering from the manifest.
8. **Record in the reviewer note.** `Jurisdiction: <codes applied>; files: <list>; portal fetched: yes/no; unpopulated codes: <list or none>.`

**Jurisdiction files this skill loads** (for each populated non-`usa` code resolved in Step 0):

- `MANIFEST.md` — `calendar` (amendments dated in the Hijri calendar are shown in both calendars) and `disclaimer`.
- `civil-transactions-law.md` — Art. 94 (a concluded contract is amended only by agreement or statute; unilateral notices of change are effective only under a clause permitting them) and Art. 37 (amendment by silence or course of dealing), used only in the Watch items.
- `electronic-transactions-law.md` — Arts. 12-13 (attribution and dispatch of electronic notices of change), used only in the Watch items.

1. **Get the documents:** From file upload, [CLM ID (coming soon)], or [repository link (coming soon)]. Accept multiple files in one invocation. If none
   provided, ask.

2. **Detect the mode** by parsing the request per the mode
   detection rules below. If a provision name is clearly stated, go straight
   to Mode 2. If no provision is mentioned, run Mode 1. Ask only if
   genuinely ambiguous.

3. **Run the workflow below.** Follow it fully.

4. **Offer follow-ups after output:**
   - "Want me to trace another provision?"
   - "Want a full playbook review of the current agreement as amended?"
     (routes to vendor-agreement-review)
   - "Want a stakeholder summary of the key changes?"
     (routes to stakeholder-summary)

## Examples

```
/commercial-legal:amendment-history acme-msa.pdf amendment-1.pdf amendment-2.pdf
```

```
/commercial-legal:amendment-history --provision indemnity
```

```
/commercial-legal:amendment-history
[paste agreement and amendment text]
```

## Matter context

**Matter context.** Check `## Matter workspaces` in the practice-level CLAUDE.md. If `Enabled` is `✗` (the default for in-house users), skip the rest of this paragraph — skills use practice-level context and the matter machinery is invisible. If enabled and there is no active matter, ask: "Which matter is this for? Run `/commercial-legal:matter-workspace switch <slug>` or say `practice-level`." Load the active matter's `matter.md` for matter-specific context and overrides. Write outputs to the matter folder at `${LEGAL_CONSULTANT_HOME:-~/.legal-consultant}/commercial-legal/matters/<matter-slug>/`. Never read another matter's files unless `Cross-matter context` is `on`.

---

## Purpose

Contracts accumulate amendments. By the third amendment, nobody remembers
what the original said or which version of a clause controls. This skill
reads the base agreement and all amendments in chronological order and
either summarizes what changed across the whole contract or traces a
specific provision through every version to find the current controlling
language.

## Mode detection

Parse the user's request to determine which mode to run. Do not ask
which mode unless the request is genuinely ambiguous.

**Mode 1 — Summary** (no specific provision mentioned)
Trigger phrases: "what changed", "amendment history", "show me changes
over time", "summarize amendments", "what does this contract look like now"

**Mode 2 — Provision trace** (specific clause or topic named)
Trigger phrases: "where's the [clause]", "latest [provision]", "how did
[term] change", "find the indemnity", "what does it say now about [topic]"

Common provision mappings:
- "indemnity" / "indemnification" → indemnification section
- "liability" / "liability cap" → limitation of liability
- "termination" → term and termination
- "data" / "privacy" / "DPA" → data protection provisions
- "IP" / "intellectual property" → IP ownership and licenses
- "price" / "fees" / "payment" → payment terms
- "auto-renewal" / "renewal" → renewal mechanics

If the term is ambiguous and maps to more than one provision, list the
candidates and ask which one:
> "I found [N] provisions related to [term] — [list them]. Which one?"

If the overall request is ambiguous between modes, ask one question:
> "Summary of all changes across the contract, or trace a specific
> provision — like indemnity, liability, or termination?"

---

## Step 1: Load and order the documents

Accept documents from any of these sources:

**[CLM integration coming soon] (if connected):**
Search by counterparty name or agreement title. Pull the base agreement
and all amendments. Record metadata typically includes execution dates —
use these to establish chronological order.

**[Document repository integration coming soon] (if connected):**
Search by counterparty name or filename. Look for files matching patterns
like "Amendment", "Addendum", "Amendment No. 1", "First Amendment", or
numbered suffixes. Pull all matches and sort by file date or filename
numbering.

**Direct upload:**
User provides files directly. In most cases the ordering is
self-explanatory from document titles (e.g., "Amendment No. 1",
"Second Amendment", "Addendum A") or dates visible in the filename
or document header — proceed without asking.

Only ask the user to confirm ordering if:
- Filenames give no indication of sequence (e.g., "agreement-final.pdf",
  "agreement-v2.pdf", "agreement-markup.pdf")
- Dates are absent from both filenames and document headers
- Two documents appear to be the same amendment version

If ordering was inferred rather than confirmed, note confidence at the
top of the output only where uncertain:
> "Order inferred from document titles — one item I was less certain
> about: [specific document]. Confirm if this affects your review."

**Ordering rules:**
- Always establish chronological order before reading content.
- If execution dates are available in metadata, use them.
- If not, look for dates in the document header or recitals
  ("This Amendment, dated as of...").
- Amendments often reference the agreement they modify ("this Amendment
  to the Master Services Agreement dated [X]") — use these references
  to confirm the chain.

## Privilege inheritance

This skill reads the base agreement and amendments — often privileged or confidential in their own right, and typically used for privileged analysis. The output inherits the source's privilege and confidentiality status. Prepend the work-product header from `${LEGAL_CONSULTANT_HOME:-~/.legal-consultant}/commercial-legal/CLAUDE.md` `## Outputs` to every output below, distribute only within the privilege circle, and store it where privileged materials live. Strip the header before any external delivery.

**Disclaimer and language.** Directly under the header, for every code applied other than `usa`, add the jurisdiction disclaimer line from the profile `## Jurisdiction`; it is never stripped. Apply the bilingual house-style rule from the profile `## Outputs`: when the output language is bilingual, or the amendments are in a jurisdiction whose authoritative language is not English and the trace quotes their text, add the authoritative-language rendering of the "Net current state" table (Mode 1) or the "Current controlling language" block (Mode 2), using the spellings in the manifest's `output_language_rule`. Where an amendment exists in two languages, quote the text the contract says prevails and note the other; if the contract is silent on which prevails, flag `[review]` (for `ksa`, `playbook-defaults.md` records the practice position as `[model knowledge — verify]`). Amounts are written in `[currency]` from the profile; dates are Gregorian; when an amendment is dated in the Hijri calendar, copy that date as written beside the Gregorian date and do not convert it (no converter in the toolset). The reviewer note carries the Step 0 record line.

**Watch items from the jurisdiction file.** For a populated non-`usa` code, add to the Watch items, citing the row: an "amendment" effected by a unilateral vendor notice is effective only under a clause permitting it (for `ksa`: `civil-transactions-law.md` Art. 94 — a concluded contract is amended only by agreement or statute); an amendment said to have been accepted by silence or course of dealing is flagged against Art. 37; an electronic notice of change is attributed and deemed dispatched under `electronic-transactions-law.md` Arts. 12-13. This skill still does not decide which document controls; it flags and routes.

## Step 2: Read and index

Read each document in chronological order. For each, extract:
- Document type (base agreement, amendment number, addendum, etc.)
- Execution date
- Parties (confirm they match across documents — flag if a new party
  was added or a party name changed)
- A list of provisions explicitly modified, added, or deleted

Build a working index before producing output. Use it internally to
drive the output — do not show it to the user.

---

## Mode 1: Summary of all changes

### Section reference rule

Every finding must include an inline section reference so the reader
can verify against the source document without searching:

  "Termination for convenience (§12.3): Added. Customer may terminate
  on 90 days written notice with no fee after the initial term."

If a provision spans multiple sections or the section number changed
across amendments, cite all references:
  "Indemnification (§9.1 base; §9.1 restated in Amendment 5)"

### Output format

```markdown
# Amendment History: [Counterparty] — [Agreement type]

**Base agreement:** [date]
**Amendments:** [N] ([date of first] → [date of last])
**Last amended:** [date]

---

## What changed — chronological

### Amendment 1 — [date]
**Purpose:** [one sentence — why this amendment existed, from recitals
or clear from context. If not stated, omit rather than guess.]

**Material changes:**
- [Provision] (§[X.X]): [what it said before → what it says now,
  in plain English]
- [New provision added] (§[X.X]): [what it does]
- [Provision deleted] (§[X.X]): [what was removed and why it matters]

### Amendment 2 — [date]
[same structure]

[repeat for each amendment]

---

## Net current state

| Provision | Current position | §Ref | Last changed |
|---|---|---|---|
| [clause] | [plain English summary] | §[X.X] | Amendment N, [date] |
| [clause] | [unchanged from base] | §[X.X] | Base agreement |

---

## Watch items
[Flag anything that looks inconsistent — e.g., an amendment modifying
a provision that was already deleted, contradictory language between
amendments, a party name that changed without a formal assignment,
or a provision where the section number shifted across documents.
Include section references on every flag.]
```

---

## Mode 2: Provision trace

### Output format

Show only what changed. Do not list amendments where the provision
was untouched — skip them entirely.

```markdown
# Provision Trace: [Provision name]
## [Counterparty] — [Agreement type]

---

### Original — [Base agreement date], §[X.X]
> "[exact quote]"

*Plain English:* [one sentence]

---

### Amendment [N] — [date], §[X.X]

**Was:**
> "[exact quote of prior language]"

**Now:**
> "[exact quote of replacement language]"

*What changed:* [one sentence — practical effect on the parties]

---

[Only subsequent amendments that touched this provision appear here.
All others are omitted.]

---

## Current controlling language

**§[X.X] — [source document, date]**
> "[exact quote]"

*Plain English:* [one sentence]

---

## Watch items
[Flags, inconsistencies, open questions — with section references.
Common items to check: whether the provision is subject to or carved
out of the liability cap; whether the section number shifted across
amendments; whether the amendment language conflicts with another
provision.]
```

If the provision was never amended after the base agreement:
> "This provision has not been modified by any amendment. Original
> language controls. §[X.X], base agreement, [date]."

---

## Close with the next-steps decision tree

End with the next-steps decision tree per CLAUDE.md `## Outputs`. Customize the options to what this skill just produced — the five default branches (draft the X, escalate, get more facts, watch and wait, something else) are a starting point, not a lock-in. The tree is the output; the lawyer picks.

## What this skill does not do

- It does not determine which document controls in the event of a
  conflict between the base agreement and an amendment — that is a
  legal interpretation question. It flags conflicts and routes to Legal.
- It does not draft new amendments.
- It does not compare against the playbook in `${LEGAL_CONSULTANT_HOME:-~/.legal-consultant}/commercial-legal/CLAUDE.md` — that is the
  vendor-agreement-review skill's job. This skill is purely historical.
- It does not infer what an amendment means if the language is
  ambiguous — it quotes exactly and flags ambiguity for Legal.
